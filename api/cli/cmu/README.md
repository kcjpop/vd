### What

A cli tool to convert CMU Pronouncing Dictionary to IPA and populate to pronunciation database.

https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict

### TODO

- IPA characters here are a bit different with the ones in Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English. For example, i: instead of iː and so on. IMO Wikipedia is more beautiful, so we might want to use them instead.

- The converter provides British and American pronunciation. Should we add both of them?

- Some conversion don't look correct, e.g. for "adamant" we have /ˈædʌmʌnt/ while on Wiktionary they are /ˈæd.ə.mənt/, /ˈæd.ə.mænt/
