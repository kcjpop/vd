## Project structure

All [pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) are in `/pages`. We should treat them as entry points and keep them as small as possible. Logic and implementation details should be in `/lib`.

Try to keep components as isolated as possible. It's fine to have duplicated code rather than bad abstraction.

## Hooks

### `useDropdown`

Located in `lib/components/useDropdown.js`.

Based on `@floating-ui` and composed as a single hook ðŸ‘‰ [Read tutorial](https://floating-ui.com/docs/tutorial).

**Basic usage:**

```jsx
import { useDropdown } from '../useDropdown'

const {
  isOpen,
  referenceProps,
  doOpenDropdown,
  doCloseDropdown,
  floatingProps,
} = useDropdown()

// This is a `reference` in @floating-ui terminology
<button
    {...referenceProps()}
    onClick={doOpenDropdown}
    onBlur={doCloseDropdown}
  />
  Show
</div>

// And this is `floating`
{isOpen && (
  <div
    className="w-40"
    {...floatingProps()}>
    Hello from here
  </div>
)}
```

`useDropdown()` can accept some configurations, e.g. `useDropdown({ placement: 'bottom-end', offset: 2 })`. Check `lib/components/useDropdown.js` for the latest settings. We can also pass in @floating-ui's middlewares here.

```jsx
// size is a re-exported middleware
import { useDropdown, size } from '../useDropdown'

const [sizeData, setSizeData] = useState()
const {
  ...
} = useDropdown({
  middleware: [size({ apply: setSizeData, padding: 10 })],
})
```
